There are two main directories:

1. tokenring - this contains scala/sbt code for Question 1

2. snapshot - this contains scala/sbt code for Question 2


To compile
---       
- navigate to root folder /tokenring & /snapshot

        $ sbt compile


Then To Run
---

        $ sbt run


To Stop Execution
---
1.tokenring
        
        $ (Enter Any Input + hit Enter key)

2.snapshot

        - Ends after two snapshots have been computed (might have some token passing after the second snapshot because this happens on the server)
